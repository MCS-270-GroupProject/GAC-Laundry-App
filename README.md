# Who Let The Clothes Out?

Welcome to _Who Let The Clothes Out?_ - an Android app designed to streamline the campus laundry process, saving students time and hassle. Say goodbye to unnecessary trips to the laundry room by knowing the real-time status of washers and dryers at your dorm building.

## Features:

**Personal Timers:** Set timers for the machines you're using, and even extend or end cycles as needed.

## How It Works

**Built with:** Android Studio (Kotlin), Firebase Database

**1. Select Your Dorm:** Choose your dorm building from the app's home page to see the status of its laundry machines.

**2. Machine Status:** View a list of machines with their real-time status and timers. Identify available machines at a glance.

**3. Personal Timer:** Set timers for the machines you're using. Only you can adjust the status of your selected machine.
